Packrat is the working name for a new Amiga (taken to mean AmigaOS 3.x, 
4.x, AROS and MorphOS) package manager.

It's goal is to be simple, self-contained and to respect Amiga conventions
whenever possible. It should also be easily portable, to take into account
users and developers using UAE or developing on a non-Amiga machine.

This archive is itself reading to be packaged up as a Packrat package,
and demonstrates the structure and features of Packrat.
