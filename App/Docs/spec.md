Packrat Specification v0.1
==========================

Introduction
------------

Packrat is an Amiga-centric but portable package manager.
It is designed to be:

 * Portable: It should be easy to build and run on AROS, AmigaOS 3.x,
   AmigaOS 4.x, MorphOS and Linux.
 * Well behaved on Amiga-platforms: Respect conventions and user choices,
   and don't step on manual changes.
 * Non-intrusive: Packrat packages should be installable without
   packrat, and users should not need to change behaviour unless
   they want to.
 * Simple to use.
 * Self-contained: Packrat includes all its dependencies other than
   lha.
 * Compact

A packrat package is a standard lha archive. It is required to be
in a format supported by lha 2.xx and Unix lha 1.14 (the default
options of either will produce working packages).

The lha archive contains files structured as follows:

 * PACKAGE/
   * control
   * postinst
   * prerm
   * startup
 * $$AppDir$$ (path found in PACKAGE/control under the "AppDir:" directive; defaults to "App" if not listed)
 * $$AppDir$$.info (optional, but recommended to faciliatet manual installation
 * EnvArc            -- Contains default configuration that will go into EnvArc:$$AppDir$$ (optional)
 * $$AppDir$$/Docs   -- Optional. If it exists, it will be marked as documentation (and optionally moved to a centralized doc repository)
 * MANIFEST(.info)   -- List of the included files
 * INSTALL(.info)    -- Instructions for manual installation, generated by Packrat
 * .. optionally any system directory with files to install to, such as Libs 
 
A Packrat *source archive* is a package of the same structure except the
PACKAGE/control file contains a "%%build" and "%%files" section that specifies
how to build the package, and  optionally a "src" directory containing the
source or a pristine source archive. The source archive may also lack $$AppDir$$,
MANIFEST/INSTALL, the former must be created by the build code, the latter will
be auto-generated.

The "startup" file contains a script to be executed on boot. If ENV:SYS/Packages exists, this script will be
put in $$AppDir$$/S and $$AppDir$$ in the script will be replaced with the empty string. Scripts should be
written accordingly. If ENV:SYS/Packages does not exist, the user will be asked if they want the startup
code to be put in S:Startup-Sequence, S:User-Startup, or if packrat should add ENV:SYS/Packages and according
code in S:Startup-Sequence. ENV:SYS/Packages stems from AROS.

To create a skeleton for a new package, you may use:

    packrat createpackage [path]
   

Building packages
-----------------

When executing

    packrat build [path]

Packrat will try to build a package. If "path" is not provided, it will look in the current working
directory.

The build process will first validate the PACKAGE directory, then check for any build requirements
listed in PACKAGE/control. Finally it will copy the package to a temporary directory in T: (the build root),
write PACKAGE/control's %%build section to T: and execute it as a script with the packages build root
as the current directory. 

It will also generate a MANIFEST file that lists all the files in the archive with their md5sums,
and an INSTALL file that contains English textual installation instructions and a description of 
Packrat.

It is intended that packrat will generate an Amiga installer script that will
check for Packrat and install the package with Packrat if present, and that will
install the package if not.

The installation process will create an uninstall script, and leave sufficient
information in the install directory to allow a fresh reinstall of packrat to
pick up the package details using *packrat scan*, or for users to run the uninstall
script to clean up the system without using packrat.

If successful, it will then use the file patterns in %%files to package up an lha archive using the
"lha" program. Packrat will by default exclude any Unix-style backup files (ending in "~") and files
in ".cvs",".svn" and ".git" directories.



Installing packages
-------------------

To install a package, use:

    packrat install [path]
	
This can currently only be the path of a local package. In the future packrat will gain
support for remote repositories.

The installation proceeds as follows:

 * Packrat uses "lha x" to unpack the archive in a temporary location.
 * Packrat sanity checks the package by checking the md5sums in the MANIFEST file.
 * Packrat then reads the control file and verifies whether or not the required and
   recommended packages are there. 
 * If the required packages are not there, installation will halt.
 * If recommended packages are not there, packrat will ask whether or not to proceed.
 * Packrat will then copy the files to the appropriate locations, and update its 
   database.
 * Packrat will create an install log and uninstall script and place it in the
   package directory for users that may wish to manually uninstall.
 * If any system files needs to be overwritten, Packrat will check its database for
   conflicts, and if so give warnings/errors. It will also regardless take backups
   of overwritten files.
   

Scanning the system
-------------------

Because Packrat is designed to act nicely with Amiga systems that are manually managed
for the most part, *packrat scan* will allow packrat to scan the disks of an Amiga system
and register information about Packrat packages that were manually installed (using the
provided installer scripts) and allow them to be registered with the package database
once packrat is installed. It will also attempt to discover and register packages that
are available but not fully installed (e.g. just unpacked, or lha archives).
